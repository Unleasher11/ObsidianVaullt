JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension used in React to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It allows you to define the structure and content of React components in a more declarative manner. JSX is not required to use React, but it provides a convenient and intuitive way to define the UI.

Here's an introduction to JSX with an example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  const name = 'John';
  const greeting = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;

  return (
    <div>
      {greeting}
      <p>Welcome to my React app.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `App` component uses JSX to define its UI. Let's break it down:

1. Importing React: React needs to be imported at the top of the file to use JSX. It provides the necessary functions and components to render and manage React elements.

2. Defining the Component: The `App` component is a functional component defined as a JavaScript function.

3. JSX Syntax: JSX is used to define the structure and content of the component's UI. It resembles HTML but is actually JavaScript. JSX elements are enclosed in angle brackets (`< >`).

4. Variables in JSX: You can use JavaScript variables within JSX by enclosing them in curly braces (`{ }`). In this example, the `name` variable is used to dynamically render the greeting message.

5. Nested Elements: JSX allows you to nest elements within each other. In this example, the `greeting` element is nested inside the `div` element.

6. Rendering Variables: JSX allows you to render variables by using them directly within the JSX code. In this case, the `greeting` variable is rendered within the JSX code.

7. Self-closing Tags: JSX allows self-closing tags for elements that don't have any children or content. In this example, the `p` element is self-closed as it doesn't have any nested elements.

8. Returning JSX: The JSX code is returned from the `App` component function. It will be rendered to the DOM by React.

JSX is transpiled by tools like Babel into regular JavaScript function calls that create React elements. It allows you to write more expressive and readable code by combining HTML-like syntax with the power and flexibility of JavaScript.

Note that JSX requires a build step, usually handled by bundlers like Webpack, to transform it into plain JavaScript that the browser can understand. The transpiled code typically includes React.createElement calls behind the scenes.

By using JSX, you can create complex UI structures, conditionally render elements, and dynamically update content based on state or props in a more straightforward and intuitive way.
