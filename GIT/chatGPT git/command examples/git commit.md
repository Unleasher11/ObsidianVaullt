## `git commit`

1. Committing with a message:
   - Example 1: Commit changes with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "Add new feature"`. This creates a new commit with the specified message. Replace "Add new feature" with a meaningful message that describes the changes made in the commit.
   - Example 2: Suppose you have fixed a bug in your code. Run `git commit -m "Fix bug: issue description"` to create a commit with a clear message indicating the bug fix. Provide a concise and informative message to summarize the nature of the commit.
   - Example 3: If you have made several changes in your project, run `git commit -m "Update files"` to create a commit with a generic message summarizing the updates made. However, it's generally better to provide more specific commit messages to aid in understanding the changes.

2. Committing with a longer message:
   - Example 1: Commit all staged changes and open the text editor to write a longer commit message: `git commit`. This launches the default text editor (e.g., Vim or Nano) for you to enter a detailed commit message. You can describe the changes made, provide context, or reference any relevant issues or references.
   - Example 2: Suppose you have made significant changes to multiple files and want to explain the rationale behind the modifications. Run `git commit` without the `-m` flag to open the text editor and write a comprehensive commit message that provides a detailed overview of the changes made.
   - Example 3: When collaborating with a team, it can be helpful to provide a comprehensive commit message that describes the purpose and impact of the changes. Use `git commit` to open the text editor and add a message that communicates the context, reasoning, and any necessary information for other team members.

3. Amending the last commit:
   - Example 1: Amend the last commit to include newly staged changes: `git commit --amend`. This command allows you to add changes to the previous commit without creating a new commit. Make sure you have staged the additional changes before running this command.
   - Example 2: Suppose you made a mistake in the last commit message. Use `git commit --amend` to modify the previous commit's message, providing the corrected information. This is useful for correcting typos or providing additional details.
   - Example 3: If you forgot to include some changes in the previous commit, stage the missing changes and run `git commit --amend` to append them to the previous commit. This helps keep related changes together in a single commit.

Remember to use meaningful commit messages that accurately describe the changes made and provide context to make it easier for others (including yourself) to understand the commit's purpose and impact.
